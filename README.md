## Abstract

&emsp;&emsp;This study aimed to determine the feasibility of expanding Team SciTrek outside of Santa Barbara, by conducting a comparative evaluation of pre/post-critical thinking assessments and cost-benefit analysis of 7th-grade conservation of mass modules.  Study methods consisted of module preparations and administration for participating 7th-grade classes.  The cost of an average 26.41% increase in critical thinking for students is $0.27 per student.  With 14 volunteers over a cumulative 5 hours, SciTrekâ€™s expansion has no financial barriers, no regional limits, and maintains its effectiveness across a variety of different learning environments.
